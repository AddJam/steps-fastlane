        Use this option if the fastlane directory is not in your repository's root.

        Working directory should be the parent directory of your Fastfile's directory.

        Example:

        * If Fastfile path: `./here/is/my/fastlane/Fastfile`
        * Then Fastfile's directory: `./here/is/my/fastlane`
        * So Working Directory should be: `./here/is/my`
